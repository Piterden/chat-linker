To determine Telegram room parameters, follow the procedure:

   observe all messages in the room
3. Manually add a bot to the room (using Telegram's invite functionality)
4. Visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<bot_api_key>/getUpdates` and extract
   `"chat"` object from there. E.g.

   ```json
   {
       "id": -1001054401089,
       "title": "bimo_test",
       "type": "supergroup"
   }

## FAQ

Does it support bridging for the one room, with a single bot?
 - No, it's not yet supported
 
It only supports supergroups from telegram? Which other types of chats are supported?
 - 

The bridge only works xmpp -> telegram, not telegram -> xmpp.
 - Remove the bot from the telegram chat, and invite it again.

I can't find any id from group when i go to `https://api.telegram.org/bot<bot_api_key>/getUpdates`
 - You have to convert your group to a supergroup on telegram, go to "Manage Group" -> "Convert to supergroup"
